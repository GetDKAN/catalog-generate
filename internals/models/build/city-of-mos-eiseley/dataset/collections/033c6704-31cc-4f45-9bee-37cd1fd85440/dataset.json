{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","contactPoint":{"fn":"Anonymous","hasEmail":"mailto:opencalifornia@govops.ca.gov"},"description":"<p>The State Contract and Procurement Registration System (SCPRS) was established in 2003, as a centralized database of information on State contracts and purchases over $5000.  eSCPRS represents the data captured in the State's eProcurement (eP) system, Bidsync, as of March 16, 2009.  The data provided is an extract from that system for fiscal years 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015</p>\n<p><strong>Data Limitations:</strong><br />\nSome purchase orders have multiple UNSPSC numbers, however only first was used to identify the purchase order. Multiple UNSPSC numbers were included to provide additional data for a DGS special event however this affects the formatting of the file. The source system Bidsync is being deprecated and these issues will be resolved in the future as state systems transition to Fi$cal.</p>\n<p><strong>Data Collection Methodology:</strong></p>\n<p>The data collection process starts with a data file from eSCPRS that is scrubbed and standardized prior to being uploaded into a SQL Server database. There are four primary tables. The Supplier, Department and United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) tables are reference tables. The Supplier and Department tables are updated and mapped to the appropriate numbering schema and naming conventions. The UNSPSC table is used to categorize line item information and requires no further manipulation.  The Purchase Order table contains raw data that requires conversion to the correct data format and mapping to the corresponding data fields. A stacking method is applied to the table to eliminate blanks where needed. Extraneous characters are removed from fields.  The four tables are joined together and queries are executed to update the final Purchase Order Dataset table. Once the scrubbing and standardization process is complete the data is then uploaded into the SQL Server database.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary/Related Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>State Contract Manual (SCM) vol. 2 <a href=\"http://www.dgs.ca.gov/pd/Resources/publications/SCM2.aspx\">http://www.dgs.ca.gov/pd/Resources/publications/SCM2.aspx</a></li>\n<li>State Contract Manual (SCM) vol. 3 <a href=\"http://www.dgs.ca.gov/pd/Resources/publications/SCM3.aspx\">http://www.dgs.ca.gov/pd/Resources/publications/SCM3.aspx</a></li>\n<li>Buying Green <a href=\"http://www.dgs.ca.gov/buyinggreen/Home.aspx\">http://www.dgs.ca.gov/buyinggreen/Home.aspx</a></li>\n<li>United Nations Standard Products and Services Code, <a href=\"http://www.unspsc.org/\">http://www.unspsc.org/</a></li>\n</ul>\n","distribution":[{"interra-reference":"purchase-order-acquisition-methods-0e7f2156-8e7b-4af4-9a5c-ab37dec70a87"},{"interra-reference":"purchase-order-data-2012-2015-ffdf78ae-49bd-4d38-b288-a31994f7c1d8"},{"interra-reference":"dgs-purchasing-data-dictionary-031a0cde-e5fa-4f8a-a725-1e7fe9d696b8"}],"identifier":"033c6704-31cc-4f45-9bee-37cd1fd85440","issued":"2016-08-11","keyword":["DVBE","Gasoline","Department","Desktop Computers","Commodity Title","Ink Cartridges","IT Goods","IT Services","Item Description","Item Name","Medical Training Services","Non-IT Goods","Non-IT Services","Notebook Computers","Paper","Photocopiers","Public Health Administration","SB","Statewide Contracts","Supplier Name","Toner","UNSPSC"],"modified":"2016-09-28","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of General Services","identifier":"california-department-of-general-services"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-124.28833007812 41.992160233376, -124.25537109375 41.869560826995, -124.34326171875 41.869560826995, -124.0576171875 41.557921577804, -124.15649414062 40.94671366508, -124.29931640625 40.613952441167, -124.48608398438 40.388396873884, -124.24438476562 40.136890695346, -123.82690429687 39.715638134796, -123.71704101562 38.891032826488, -123.16772460938 38.453588708941, -122.96997070312 38.160476280996, -123.046875 37.987504371064, -122.72827148438 37.892195547244, -122.51953125 37.675125278921, -122.50854492188 37.509725842938, -122.39868164062 37.361425501905, -122.42065429688 37.186578595249, -122.18994140625 36.932330061503, -121.8603515625 36.914764288956, -121.78344726562 36.738884124394, -122.01416015625 36.615527631349, -121.904296875 36.297418186508, -121.22314453125 35.612650818757, -120.95947265625 35.398005947151, -120.88256835937 35.308401401692, -120.849609375 35.191766965947, -120.64086914062 35.083955579276, -120.64086914062 34.642247047769, -120.46508789062 34.470335121217, -119.53125 34.406909656521, -119.30053710938 34.179997586881, -119.19067382812 34.098159345216, -118.7841796875 34.016241889667, -118.49853515625 34.016241889667, -118.46557617187 33.897777013859, -118.48754882812 33.77001515278, -118.33374023438 33.706062655101, -118.11401367188 33.742612777347, -117.79541015625 33.541394668983, -117.34497070312 33.201924189779, -117.19116210938 32.741082231501, -117.12524414063 32.55607364492, -115.91674804688 32.630123006707, -114.697265625 32.694865977875, -114.48852539062 33.587167339047, -114.49951171875 34.016241889667, -114.169921875 34.307143856288, -114.55444335938 34.723554927042, -114.67529296875 35.020999701115, -120.05859375 39.027718840212, -119.970703125 41.967659203678))","temporal":"2012-01-02T05:00:00+00:00/2016-01-01T05:00:00+00:00","theme":["Grants and Contracts"],"title":"Purchase Order Data","accessLevel":"public","interra-published":true}

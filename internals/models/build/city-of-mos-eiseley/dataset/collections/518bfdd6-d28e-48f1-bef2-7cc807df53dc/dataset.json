DWR staff then reviews the submitted plans to make sure they have completed the requirements identified in the Water Code, Sections §10608– 10656, then submits a report to the Legislature summarizing the status of the plans.</p>\n<p>For each round of UWMPs, DWR provides guidance for urban water suppliers. This includes preparation of a Guidebook, workshops, and program staff to assist in preparing comprehensive and useful water management plans, implementation of water conservation programs, and understanding the requirements of the Act.</p>\n<p>For additional information please visit: <a href=\"http://www.water.ca.gov/urbanwatermanagement/\">http://www.water.ca.gov/urbanwatermanagement/</a></p>\n","distribution":[{"interra-reference":"2015-uwmp-table-2-1-retail-only-public-water-systems-9bb2d3d6-33e2-409a-a984-34a10118bc45"},{"interra-reference":"2015-uwmp-table-3-1-retail-population-current-and-projected-e9692854-b198-4d18-b0db-6908758cdce4"},{"interra-reference":"2015-uwmp-table-4-1-retail-demands-for-potable-and-raw-water-actual-989d813d-f8ab-40fa-b15c-68efb4026aa3"},{"interra-reference":"2015-uwmp-table-6-1-retail-groundwater-volume-pumped-9a4494a1-2128-47e9-9306-975d0d44bdc7"},{"interra-reference":"2015-uwmp-table-6-2-retail-wastewater-collected-within-service-area-in-2015-1d958387-30cd-44f4-86eb-a0d69d71c1ff"},{"interra-reference":"2015-uwmp-table-6-3-retail-wastewater-treatment-and-discharge-within-service-area-in-2015-54ad8ce7-3251-41cb-aeac-d42479d56741"},{"interra-reference":"2015-uwmp-table-6-4-retail-current-and-projected-recycled-water-direct-beneficial-uses-within-service-area-9dc0d882-cf45-47e3-9a0e-0f9cfe0f8e05"}],"identifier":"518bfdd6-d28e-48f1-bef2-7cc807df53dc","issued":"2016-10-20","keyword":["Water"],"modified":"2016-11-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of Water Resources","identifier":"california-department-of-water-resources"},"references":["http://www.water.ca.gov/urbanwatermanagement/","http://www.water.ca.gov/urbanwatermanagement/uwmp2015.cfm","https://wuedata.water.ca.gov/uwmp_export.asp"],"spatial":"POLYGON ((-124.541015625 42.032974332441, -119.8388671875 42.000325148316, -119.794921875 38.891032826488, -114.873046875 35.173808318, -114.0380859375 34.27083595165, -114.5654296875 32.583849325657, -117.2021484375 32.398515802474, -118.916015625 33.833919953655, -120.673828125 34.415973384482, -122.783203125 36.879620605027, -124.716796875 40.178873314347))","theme":["Water"],"title":"Urban Water Management Plans (UWMP) 2015","accessLevel":"public","interra-published":true}

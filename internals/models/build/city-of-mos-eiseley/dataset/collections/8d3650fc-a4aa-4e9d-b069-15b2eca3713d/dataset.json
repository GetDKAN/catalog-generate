This category is used only in California and was developed in cooperation with the California Cattlemen&#039;s Association, University of California Cooperative Extension, and other groups interested in the extent of grazing activities.\r\nEnumerated_Domain:\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value: Urban and Built-Up Land (D)\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value_Definition:\r\nUrban and Built-Up land is occupied by structures with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres, or approximately 6 structures to a 10-acre parcel. Common examples include residential, industrial, commercial, institutional facilities, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, and water control structures.\r\nEnumerated_Domain:\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value: Other Land (X)\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value_Definition:\r\nLand which does not meet the criteria of any other category. Typical uses include low density rural development, heavily forested land, mined land, or government land with restrictions on use. This category was subdivided into R, V, Cl, and nv beginning with the 2004 data in 8 San Joaquin Valley counties and Mendocino County. Subsequently, R was subdivided into sAC and R beginning with the 2006 data.\r\nEnumerated_Domain:\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value: Water (W)\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value_Definition: Water areas with an extent of at least 40 acres.\r\nEnumerated_Domain:\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value: Rural Residential Land (R)\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value_Definition:\r\nThis includes residential areas of one to five structures per ten acres.\r\nEnumerated_Domain:\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value: Vacant or Disturbed Land (V)\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value_Definition:\r\nThis consists of open field areas that do not qualify for an agricultural category, mineral and oil extraction areas, and rural freeway interchanges.\r\nEnumerated_Domain:\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value: Confined Animal Agriculture (Cl)\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value_Definition:\r\nThis includes aquaculture, dairies, feedlots, and poultry facilities.\r\nEnumerated_Domain:\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value: Nonagricultural and Natural Vegetation (nv)\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value_Definition:\r\nThis covers heavily wooded, rocky or barren areas, riparian and wetland areas, grassland areas which do not qualify for Grazing Land due to their size or land management restrictions, and small water bodies. Constructed wetlands are also included in this category.\r\nEnumerated_Domain:\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value: Semi-Agricultural and Rural Commercial Land (sAC)\r\nEnumerated_Domain_Value_Definition:\r\nThis includes farmsteads, agricultural storage and packing sheds, unpaved parking areas, composting facilities, equine facilities, firewood lots, and campgrounds.\r\nAttribute:\r\nAttribute_Label: POLYGON_AC\r\nAttribute_Definition: The acreage of the polygon feature.\r\nAttribute_Definition_Source: Computer calculated.\r\nAttribute:\r\nAttribute_Label: COUNTY_NAM\r\nAttribute_Definition: County name identified by a three letter abbreviation.\r\nAttribute_Definition_Source:\r\nCounty abbreviations are in the text file located at the following url: &lt;ftp://consrv.ca.gov/pub/dlrp/FMMP/county_index.txt&gt;\r\nAttribute_Domain_Values:\r\nUnrepresentable_Domain: Coordinates defining the features.\r\nAttribute:\r\nAttribute_Label: UPD_YEAR\r\nAttribute_Definition: The year the data was captured.\r\nAttribute_Definition_Source: FMMP updates their data biennially.\r\nAttribute:\r\nAttribute_Label: SHAPE_LENG\r\nAttribute_Definition: Perimeter of the polygon feature in meters.\r\nAttribute_Definition_Source: Computer calculated.\r\nAttribute_Domain_Values:\r\nUnrepresentable_Domain: Positive real numbers that are automatically generated.\r\nAttribute:\r\nAttribute_Label: SHAPE_AREA\r\nAttribute_Definition: Area of feature in meters squared.\r\nAttribute_Definition_Source: Computer calculated.\r\nAttribute_Domain_Values:\r\nUnrepresentable_Domain: Positive real numbers that are automatically generated.\r\nDistribution_Information:\r\nDistributor:\r\nContact_Information:\r\nContact_Organization_Primary:\r\nContact_Organization:\r\nCalifornia Department of Conservation, Division of Land Resource Protection, Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program\r\nContact_Position: Staff\r\nContact_Address:\r\nAddress_Type: mailing and physical address\r\nAddress: 801 K Street MS 14-15\r\nCity: Sacramento\r\nState_or_Province: California\r\nPostal_Code: 95814-3528\r\nCountry: USA\r\nContact_Voice_Telephone: 916-324-0850\r\nContact_Facsimile_Telephone: 916-327-3430\r\nContact_Electronic_Mail_Address: fmmp@conservation.ca.gov\r\nResource_Description:\r\nDownloadable Data.

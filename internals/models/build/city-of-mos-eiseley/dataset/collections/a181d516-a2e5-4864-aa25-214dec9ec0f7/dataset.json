Under the leadership of Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., California has undertaken an ambitious effort to green the state’s buildings and save taxpayer dollars in the process.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Governor Brown issued a sweeping executive order directing all state agencies, departments, and other state entities to reduce their grid energy use by 20 percent by 2018 (compared to a 2003 baseline). In addition to energy reduction goals, the executive order also called for a reduction of 20 percent of state water use by 2020 (compared to a 2010 baseline). The water use reduction goal is accelerated to 25 percent by the end of 2015 under the state's first-ever statewide mandatory water reductions announced in April.</p>\n<p>The files provided here are the data behind the visualizations in the CA Sustainable Buildings website, <a href=\"http://www.greenbuildings.ca.gov/\" title=\"CA Sustainable Buildings\">http://www.greenbuildings.ca.gov/</a></p>\n<p><strong>STATE WATER USE</strong><br />\nThe most recent data shows that collectively, state departments have already met the 20 percent water use reduction goal set forth in the executive order and are currently working to increase conservation to the levels outlined in the state’s first-ever mandatory water reductions.</p>\n<p>These savings were achieved by reducing outdoor irrigation, as well as upgrades to plumbing fixtures and removal of ornamental turf, and other conservation measures.</p>\n<p><strong>STATE ENERGY USE</strong><br />\nIn 2003, state agencies collectively consumed nearly 12 billion kBTU (thousand British Thermal Units) of electricity and natural gas combined, equal to the energy used by 175,000 California homes.</p>\n<p>The most recent data shows a double-digit percentage reduction since 2003. These savings have resulted from retrofits of lighting and mechanical systems for improved efficiency, onsite renewable energy, and conservation measures.</p>\n","distribution":[{"interra-reference":"ca-sustainable-buildings-department-data-874f4fac-5541-4b55-bac2-e9bfdd11de4f"},{"interra-reference":"ca-sustainable-buildings-energy-baseline-c456b03a-ca06-404b-826a-c86d59b52c6a"},{"interra-reference":"ca-sustainable-buildings-greenhouse-gas-baseline-38879908-f3d8-49d2-a1d4-6127493aa57b"},{"interra-reference":"ca-sustainable-buildings-solar-energy-504ca1e9-be1f-4811-8a45-1208b8a65081"},{"interra-reference":"ca-sustainable-buildings-water-baseline-002a66f4-2a74-40e6-822f-e3c3ed26c67d"}],"identifier":"a181d516-a2e5-4864-aa25-214dec9ec0f7","issued":"2016-08-31","keyword":["Energy Efficiency","Energy","GreenBuilding","Buildings","State Buildings","Sustainability","Water"],"modified":"2016-10-07","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Department of General Services","identifier":"california-department-of-general-services"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-124.25537109375 41.967659203678, -119.94873046875 41.934976500547, -119.94873046875 38.959408792454, -114.06005859375 34.379712580462, -114.49951171875 34.016241889667, -114.63134765625 33.614619292334, -114.80712890625 33.284619968888, -114.54345703125 32.731840896866, -117.00439453125 32.546813173515, -117.31201171875 33.137551192346, -118.05908203125 33.724339661748, -118.63037109375 33.906895551289, -119.20166015625 33.979808728725, -119.33349609375 34.27083595165, -120.21240234375 34.452218472827, -120.56396484375 34.452218472827, -120.60791015625 34.957995310868, -120.87158203125 35.317366329238, -121.31103515625 35.782170703266, -121.79443359375 36.137874718407, -121.92626953125 36.421282443649, -121.79443359375 36.774092494642, -121.92626953125 36.949891786813, -122.23388671875 37.090239803072, -122.45361328125 37.509725842938, -122.54150390625 37.78808138412, -122.93701171875 37.857507156252, -122.89306640625 38.134556577054, -123.55224609375 38.754083275791, -123.68408203125 39.232253141715, -123.77197265625 39.740986355884, -124.12353515625 40.044437584609, -124.34326171875 40.413496049702, -124.25537109375 40.680638025215, -124.03564453125 41.013065787006, -124.07958984375 41.40977583201, -124.21142578125 41.705728515238))","theme":["Buildings","Water"],"title":"CA Sustainable Buildings","interra-published":true}

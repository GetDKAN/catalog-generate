The program supports the protection and management of California's agricultural lands through planning and permanent protection of farm and ranch lands via agricultural easements. SALC will prevent increases in GHG emissions by limiting opportunities for expansive, vehicle dependent forms of development in favor of more focused, compact, and transit oriented development within discrete growth boundaries. In future years, SALC is proposed to support farm-scale conservation management practices that further promote reductions in GHG emissions and increases in soil carbon sequestration.</p>\n","distribution":[{"interra-reference":"sustainable-agricultural-land-conservation-salc-program-awards-fd873da4-0757-4d2c-a9dc-0728458c63aa"},{"interra-reference":"sustainable-agricultural-land-conservation-program-salc-data-dictionary-278aa041-8f02-4ee1-833b-1cdd8ad079c2"}],"identifier":"a99cfb3a-e323-40d2-9d39-ffb0de2dcffb","issued":"2017-01-11","keyword":["Agriculture","CDFA","DOC","Farmland","Resources","SALC","SGC","Conservation"],"modified":"2017-01-13","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"California Strategic Growth Council","identifier":"california-strategic-growth-council"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-124.07958984375 42.000325148316, -119.94873046875 42.000325148316, -120.03662109375 39.061849134292, -114.06005859375 34.27083595165, -114.49951171875 33.870415550942, -114.45556640625 33.614619292334, -114.71923828125 33.431441335575, -114.67529296875 33.100745405144, -114.45556640625 32.916485347314, -114.63134765625 32.583849325657, -117.00439453125 32.509761735919, -117.26806640625 33.063924198121, -117.88330078125 33.760882000869, -118.54248046875 34.052659421376, -119.06982421875 34.052659421376, -119.33349609375 34.27083595165, -119.90478515625 34.524661471772, -120.56396484375 34.488447837809, -120.56396484375 34.885930940753, -120.87158203125 35.317366329238, -121.04736328125 35.603718740697, -121.79443359375 36.244273184939, -121.83837890625 36.562600037385, -121.83837890625 36.879620605027, -122.18994140625 37.055177106661, -122.36572265625 37.300275281344, -122.49755859375 37.579412513438, -122.18994140625 37.649034021579, -122.32177734375 37.857507156252, -122.89306640625 37.857507156252, -122.89306640625 38.169114135561, -123.24462890625 38.479394673276, -123.64013671875 38.822590976177, -123.77197265625 39.232253141715, -123.77197265625 39.673370391766, -123.99169921875 39.909736234537, -124.25537109375 40.245991504199, -124.38720703125 40.513799155044, -124.12353515625 40.880294805528, -124.03564453125 41.376808565702))","temporal":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00/2018-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Sustainable Agricultural Land Conservation Program Awards (SALC)","interra-published":true}

The 2016 TIGER/Line Shapefiles contain current geography for the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. Current geography in the 2016 TIGER/Line Shapefiles generally reflects the boundaries of governmental units in effect as of January 1, 2016, and other legal and statistical area boundaries that have been adjusted and/or corrected since the 2010 Census. This vintage includes boundaries of governmental units that match the data from the surveys that use 2016 geography, such as the 2016 Population Estimates and the 2016 American Community Survey.</p>\n<p>The 2016 TIGER/Line Shapefiles contain the geographic extent and boundaries of both legal and statistical entities. A legal entity is a geographic entity whose boundaries, name, origin, and area description result from charters, laws, treaties, or other administrative or governmental action. A statistical entity is any geographic entity or combination of entities identified and defined solely for the tabulation and presentation of data. Statistical entity boundaries are not legally defined and the entities have no governmental standing.</p>\n","distribution":[{"interra-reference":"ca-county-boundaries-f5651a8a-6c01-458c-8b44-dfc9c790d890"},{"interra-reference":"ca-state-boundary-1d9fcacf-79eb-4da1-aee3-6f8e64919fe3"},{"interra-reference":"ca-places-boundaries-a39aac7d-2c20-4c75-a40f-da7557143de8"}],"identifier":"e995509d-566a-43d7-99d5-3416e3167e9d","issued":"2017-02-02","keyword":["Boundaries","Boundary","California","Counties","Geography","Geospatial","GIS","Places","Spatial","State","County"],"modified":"2017-02-03","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.ca.gov","identifier":"datacagov"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-124.3212890625 42.032974332441, -120.0146484375 41.967659203678, -119.970703125 38.993572058209, -114.08203125 34.307143856288, -114.4775390625 33.943359946579, -114.3896484375 33.724339661748, -114.609375 33.541394668983, -114.78515625 33.321348526699, -114.78515625 33.063924198121, -114.3896484375 32.953368145799, -114.5654296875 32.805744732907, -114.9609375 32.657875736955, -116.982421875 32.583849325657, -117.333984375 33.321348526699, -118.037109375 33.797408767572, -118.30078125 34.052659421376, -119.1357421875 34.052659421376, -119.3994140625 34.379712580462, -119.970703125 34.452218472827, -120.5859375 34.452218472827, -120.673828125 34.777715803605, -120.849609375 35.281500657891, -121.1572265625 35.675147436085, -121.9921875 36.385912772877, -121.8603515625 36.633162095587, -121.81640625 36.949891786813, -122.34375 37.230328387604, -122.431640625 37.544577320856, -122.607421875 37.857507156252, -122.958984375 37.961523313966, -123.046875 38.376115424036, -123.7060546875 38.856820134744, -123.92578125 39.707186656827, -124.2333984375 40.178873314347, -124.453125 40.413496049702, -124.189453125 40.81380923057, -124.189453125 41.376808565702))","title":"CA Geographic Boundaries","interra-published":true}

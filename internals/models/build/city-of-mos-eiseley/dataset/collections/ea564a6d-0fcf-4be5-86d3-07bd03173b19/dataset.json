Watershed Boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. The intent of defining Hydrologic Units (HU) for the Watershed Boundary Dataset is to establish a base-line drainage boundary framework, accounting for all land and surface areas. At a minimum, the WBD is being delineated and georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 scale topographic base map meeting National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Hydrologic units are given a Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC).</p>\n","distribution":[{"interra-reference":"ca-usgs-watershed-boundary-dataset-12-digit-hydrologic-units-65e26188-80fd-48d7-bba9-d1a90e0b1141"}],"identifier":"ea564a6d-0fcf-4be5-86d3-07bd03173b19","issued":"2017-02-02","keyword":["Drainage","HUC","Hydrologic","USGS","Watershed","WBD","Water"],"modified":"2017-02-03","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.ca.gov","identifier":"datacagov"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-124.189453125 41.967659203678, -120.0146484375 42.000325148316, -119.970703125 38.925229047141, -114.2138671875 34.307143856288, -114.5654296875 33.833919953655, -114.697265625 33.358061612779, -114.78515625 33.174341551002, -114.521484375 32.842673631954, -114.78515625 32.620870183181, -117.0703125 32.472695022062, -117.3779296875 33.174341551002, -117.9931640625 33.651208299205, -118.388671875 34.052659421376, -119.091796875 34.052659421376, -119.53125 34.452218472827, -120.1025390625 34.415973384482, -120.5859375 34.524661471772, -120.673828125 35.065973137984, -120.9375 35.353216101238, -121.201171875 35.675147436085, -121.9921875 36.350527005428, -121.81640625 36.738884124394, -121.904296875 36.985003092856, -122.5634765625 37.265309955619, -122.5634765625 37.683820326694, -122.958984375 37.996162679728, -123.046875 38.307180561883, -123.7060546875 38.891032826488, -123.7939453125 39.436192999314, -123.9697265625 39.876019419621, -124.3212890625 40.245991504199, -124.3212890625 40.580584664128, -124.189453125 41.112468789181))","theme":["Water"],"title":"CA USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset (12-Digit Hydrologic Units) ","interra-published":true}

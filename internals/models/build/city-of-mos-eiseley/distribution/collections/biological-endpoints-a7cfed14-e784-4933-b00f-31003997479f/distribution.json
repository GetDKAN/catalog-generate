The California Stream Condition Index (CSCI), a measure of biological condition based on benthic macroinvertebrates, was calculated at each of these sites and provides a consistent way to characterize biological condition across multiple river-types. For more information on the CSCI, refer to the <a href=\"http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioassessment/docs/csci_factsheet.pdf\">CSCI Fact Sheet</a>. The underlying bioassessment data is from sampling programs supported by the California State Water Resources Control Board's Surface Water Monitoring Program (SWAMP).</p>\n","title":"Biological Endpoints","identifier":"biological-endpoints-a7cfed14-e784-4933-b00f-31003997479f"}

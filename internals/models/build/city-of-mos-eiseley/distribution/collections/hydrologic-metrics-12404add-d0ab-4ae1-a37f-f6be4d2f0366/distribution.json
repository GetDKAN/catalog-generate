The degree of hydrologic alteration at each site is assessed by comparing estimates of present-day and historical flows using a set of regionally calibrated hydrologic models. The hydrologic metrics in this dataset can be compared to the biological condition at corresponding sites (described in the Biological Endpoints dataset) to estimate the probability of good biological conditions along gradients of increasing hydrologic alteration.</p>\n","title":"Hydrologic Metrics","identifier":"hydrologic-metrics-12404add-d0ab-4ae1-a37f-f6be4d2f0366"}

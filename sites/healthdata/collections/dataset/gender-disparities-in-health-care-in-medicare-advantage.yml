description: "<p>This report reveals sizable differences in quality of treatment for certain conditions among MA beneficiaries. In particular, women received better treatment for chronic lung disease and rheumatoid arthritis and were more likely than men to receive proper follow-up care after being hospitalized for a mental health disorder. In contrast, women were less likely than men to receive timely treatment for alcohol or drug dependence, and they were more likely to be dispensed medications that are potentially harmful to people with certain medical conditions such as dementia.</p>\n"

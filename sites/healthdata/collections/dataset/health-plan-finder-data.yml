description: "<p>The Affordable Care Act requires that HHS establish a mechanism, including an internet website, through which a resident of, or small business in, any State may identify affordable health insurance coverage options in that State.  The Healthcare.gov website has been displaying data collected from individual and small group insurance issuers in its Plan Finder since July, 2010. The information provided allows consumers and researchers to more fully understand the current health insurance marketplace while opening the door of opportunity for innovative developers to provide this information in creative ways to more Americans.</p>\n"

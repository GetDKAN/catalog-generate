description: "<p>Since October 1, 1983, most hospitals have been paid under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system (PPS). However, certain types of specialty hospitals and units were excluded from PPS because the PPS diagnosis related groups do not accurately account for the resource costs for the types of patients treated in those facilities. Facilities originally excluded from PPS included rehabilitation, psychiatric, childrens, cancer, and long term care hospitals, rehabilitation and psychiatric hospital distinct part units, and hospitals located outside the 50 states and Puerto Rico.</p>\n"

Provisional counts of births, deaths, and infant deaths are based on data received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified date and may be updated during the course of a data year.</p>\n<p>NOTES: Figures include all revisions received from the states and, therefore, may differ from those previously published. Data are provisional and are subject to monthly reporting variation. National data are calculated by summing the number of events reported by state of residence; counts are rounded to the nearest thousand (births and deaths) or hundred (infant deaths). Provisional counts may differ by approximately 2% from final counts, due to rounding and reporting variation. Additionally, the accuracy of the provisional counts may change over time. For discussion of the nature, source, and limitations of the data, see \"Technical Notes\" of the report, Births, Marriages, Divorces, and Deaths: Provisional Data for 2009.

description: "<p>The CMS Office of Enterprise Data and Analytics has developed CMS Program Statistics, which includes detailed summary statistics on national health care, Medicare populations, utilization, and expenditures, as well as counts for Medicare-certified institutional and non-institutional providers. CMS Program Statistics is organized into sections which can be downloaded and viewed separately.  Tables and maps will be posted as they become finalized. CMS Program Statistics is replacing the Medicare and Medicaid Statistical Supplement, which was published annually in electronic form from 2001-2013.</p>\n"

description: "<p>States have the option to provide children with 12 months of continuous coverage through Medicaid and CHIP, even if the family experiences a change in income during the year. Continuous eligibility is a valuable tool that helps States ensure that children stay enrolled in the health coverage for which they are eligible and have consistent access to needed health care services.</p>\n"

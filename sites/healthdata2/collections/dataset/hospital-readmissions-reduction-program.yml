description: "<p>In October 2012, CMS began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospitalâs number of âpredictedâ 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be âexpected,â based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.</p>\n"

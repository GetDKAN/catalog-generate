State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System.  YRBSS Data. The YRBS is conducted biennially and collects data on a variety of youth risk behaviors including tobacco use. The YRBS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in high schools (grades 9-12).  The YRBS uses SUDAAN to calculate asymmetric confidence intervals based on the logit transformation. The logit transformation constrains confidence interval limits to vary between a lower limit of 0% and an upper limit of 100%.   The data for the STATE System were extracted from YRBSS surveys from participating states.  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, and smokeless tobacco products prevalence.</p>\n"
